The dataset consists of 4 workbooks which are airport which contains the airports names, airlines(contains the airlines name),cancellation(contains reasons for cancellation) and flight.The flight workbook contains 5,000,000+ rows and 36 columns. Some of these columns include Airlines, flight number, tail number, origin airport, destination airport, scheduled departure, departure time, departure delay, scheduled time, air time, elapsed time, diverted, cancelled e .t. c

- variation of delayed flight per month
- 
- total number of flights cancelled in 2015
- % of cancellation due to weather and % due to airline/carrier
- the most and least reliable airline in terms of on-time departure

# Skills and Concept Demonstrated
